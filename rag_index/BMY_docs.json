Our focus as a biopharmaceutical company is on discovering, developing and delivering transformational medicines for patients facing serious diseases in areas where we believe that we have an opportunity to make a meaningful difference: oncology, hematology, immunology, cardiovascular, neuroscience and other areas where we can also create long-term value. Our priorities are to focus on transformational medicines where we have a competitive advantage, drive operational excellence and strategically allocate capital for long-term growth and shareholder returns. We are driving commercial execution in our key first-in-class and/or best-in-class marketed products, where we continue to expand and see potential for further expansion into the future.

These pressures stem from legislative and policy changes, including price controls, pharmaceutical market access, discounting, changes to tax and importation laws and other restrictions in the U.S., EU and other regions around the world. These pressures have resulted in lower prices, lower reimbursement rates and smaller populations for whom payers will reimburse, which can negatively impact our results of operations (including intangible asset impairment charges), operating cash flow, liquidity and financial flexibility. In August 2024, as part of the first round of government price setting pursuant to the IRA, the HHS announced the \"maximum fair price\" for a 30-day equivalent supply of Eliquis, which applies to the U.S. Medicare channel effective January 1, 2026. In January 2025, the HHS selected Pomalyst as a medicine subject to \"negotiation\" for government-set prices beginning in 2027. It is possible that more of our products could be selected in future years based upon the selection criteria currently utilized by the HHS or potentially expanded future criteria.

On July 31, 2025, the Trump administration sent letters to several pharmaceutical manufacturers, including BMS, which outlined steps that such manufacturers should take to advance certain objectives of the executive order.

Additionally, year-to-date revenues were impacted by the redesign of the U.S. Medicare Part D program. Average U.S. net selling prices decreased 5% year-to-date compared to the corresponding period a year ago.\n\nInternational\n\nInternational revenues increased 6% during the third quarter of 2025 and 4% year-to-date, primarily due to higher demand across the Growth Portfolio and for Eliquis, partially offset by generic erosion within the remainder of the Legacy Portfolio. Excluding the impacts of foreign exchange, international revenues increased 3% during the third quarter of 2025 and year-to-date.\n\nNo single country outside the U.S. contributed more than 10% of total revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.

The analysis showed that Camzyos (mavacamten) was associated with reductions in left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction and improvements in symptom burden in a racially diverse population of patients with symptomatic oHCM treated in an international, real-world setting. The effectiveness and safety demonstrated in COLLIGO-HCM are consistent with results from randomized, controlled clinical trials and further support the growing body of evidence for Camzyos , the first and only approved cardiac myosin inhibitor, as a standard of care for New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-III symptomatic oHCM.\n\niberdomide RRMM September 2025 Announced that the Phase III EXCALIBER-RRMM study evaluating iberdomide combined with standard therapies in patients with RRMM demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity rates, compared with the control arm, in a planned interim analysis of the MRD endpoint.

Our critical accounting policies are those that significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Because of this uncertainty, actual results may vary from these estimates. For a discussion of our critical accounting policies, refer to \"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our 2024 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2025.
